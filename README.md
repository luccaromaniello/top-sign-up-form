# The Odin Project: Sign-up Form
[Sign-up Form challenge](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form) from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) course structure.

## Solution

The solution is available at (coming soon).

## Overview

By the time this challenge was completed, the core concepts of this challenge include:
- Recreate the provided design layout (`original-layout.png` in the repository), with the option to customize some aspects of it.
- Use only HTML and pure CSS (no frameworks or libraries).
- Focus on semantic HTML and form validation using HTML5 (JavaScript validation comes in later projects).

## Observations
- The course gets regular updates from the open-source community, so things might look a little different now compared to when this project was done.
- The original project instructions can be found in the `original-instructions.png` file.
